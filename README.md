## About me
I am Akshay R Kulkarni, a first-year PhD student at University of California San Diego (UCSD) where I am working with [Prof. Tsui-Wei (Lily) Weng](https://lilywenglab.github.io/) on Interpretable and Robust Machine Learning.

During Summer 2023, I worked as a Research Intern at Sony R&D Center, Tokyo on Labeled Dataset Generation using Generative AI models.

Prior to this, I was a Project Assistant at the [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/), [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) working with [Prof. R. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) and his Ph.D. student, [Jogendra Nath Kundu](https://sites.google.com/view/jogendra/). My work here focused on Domain Adaptation for Object Recognition and Semantic Segmentation.

I completed my undergraduate from [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur](http://vnit.ac.in/) in 2020, where I was a core coordinator at [IvLabs (Robotics Lab)](http://www.ivlabs.in/). I also served as it's Chairman and as the Secretary for the IEEE VNIT Student Branch, both during 2018-19.
