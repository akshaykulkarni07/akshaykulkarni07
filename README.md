## About me
I am Akshay R Kulkarni, a Project Assistant at the [Video Analytics Lab](https://val.cds.iisc.ac.in/), [IISc, Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Dr. R. Venkatesh Babu](http://cds.iisc.ac.in/faculty/venky/) and his Ph.D. student, [Jogendra Nath Kundu](https://sites.google.com/view/jogendra/). My major research interests are in the **applications of Deep Learning to Computer Vision and Robotics** and my recent work has focused on Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation.

I will be pursuing MS in CS at Univ. of California, San Diego (UCSD) starting in Fall 2022.

I completed my undergraduate from [Visvesvaraya National Institute of Technology, Nagpur](http://vnit.ac.in/) in 2020, where I was a core coordinator at [IvLabs (Robotics Lab)](http://www.ivlabs.in/). I also served as it's Chairman and as the Secretary for the IEEE VNIT Student Branch, both during 2018-19.
